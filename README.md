###Forked from https://github.com/udacity/AIND-Simulated_Annealing

####Implemented the following functions for the Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals:
1. simulated_annealing() main loop function in Section II
2. successors() and get_value() methods in section III for TSP Problem
3. schedule() function to define the temperature schedule in Section IV

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook AIND-Simulated_Annealing.ipynb
